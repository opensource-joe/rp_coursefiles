# Finding and Fixing Code Bugs
https://realpython.com/courses/python-basics-code-bugs/

Course uses IDLE debugger.

## Breakpoints, Go, and Quit

Breakpoints tell the debugger to pause to allow for manual inspection. Go runs all code until next breakpoint. Stop the debugging session using Quit.

Use Run and Debug in VSCode to walkthrough code, set breakpoints, etc.

No debugger. Use print debugging by using print() to display text in the console to indicate what the program is executing and the state of programs variables.
